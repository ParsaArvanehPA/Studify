            <div class="meta-info">
                <strong>Authors:</strong> Esperanza Bielsa & Susan Bassnett<br>
                <strong>Source:</strong> Translation in Global News (2008), Chapter 7<br>
                <strong>Focus:</strong> Veracity, Authenticity, and Manipulation in News Translation
            </div>
        </header>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Central Paradox</h3>
            <p>We cling to the importance of truthfulness in news reporting, yet <strong>news production processes are inherently multiple, complex, and manipulative</strong>. When news is transposed interlingually, the question becomes: <em>to what extent can any translation be said to be a truthful, accurate rendering?</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Truthfulness and News Reporting</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>The Fundamental Premise</h3>
            <p>News transmission rests on assumption that it should be <strong>truthful</strong>. Readers/viewers expect honest relay of information. When proven false, public outrage ensues.</p>

            <h4>Example: British Newspaper Editor Resignation (2004)</h4>
            <p>Editor forced to resign after authorizing publication of photographs purporting to show British soldiers abusing prisoners in Iraq - turned out to be fakes.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Reality of News Production</h3>
        <div class="scholar-box">
            <p>The end product that is read or seen has been:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shaped</strong> for receivers</li>
                <li><strong>Mediated</strong> through several sets of filters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time/space constraints</li>
                        <li>Editorial policy</li>
                        <li>Cultural acceptability</li>
                        <li>Market positioning</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Manipulated</strong> - multiplicity accentuated when news transposed interlingually</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Skopos Theory and News Translation</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Why Skopos Theory Works for News</h3>
            <p><strong>Skopos theory</strong> (Vermeer) is one of the most useful approaches for news translation because it is premised on notion of <strong>equivalent effect</strong>, NOT on any notion of exact textual transference.</p>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>Has limitations when comparing how same translated news story is presented in different newspapers. Divergence of presentational aspects takes us beyond interlingual into other textual manipulation in target culture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h3>Alberto Orengo (2005)</h3>
            <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> Theory of <strong>'localization'</strong> for examining how news items are shaped for what he calls <strong>'sub-locales'</strong> in Italian newspapers</p>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Ideological constraints come to fore; different conventions operate not only across countries but within each country (huge divergencies driven by market and politics)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Difficulty in Analyzing News Translation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Different conventions in different countries</li>
                <li>Huge divergencies within each country (market and politically driven)</li>
                <li>Yet: common threads discernible in story presentation</li>
                <li><strong>Commonality driven by accessibility to shared VISUAL IMAGES, rather than common verbal elements</strong></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>3. Case Study: Saddam Hussein - Capture and Trial</h2>

        <h3>3.1 The Capture (December 2003)</h3>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Visual Narrative: From Powerful Dictator to Abject Prisoner</h3>

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>Saddam Hussein captured after Allied troops defeated his forces. War degenerated into occupation with spiraling violence.</p>

            <h4>The Defining Image: Dental Examination</h4>
            <p>Particularly striking photograph showed Saddam undergoing intrusive dental examination immediately after arrest.</p>

            <h4>Multiple Connotations of This Degrading Image:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Emphasized fall from high position to present powerlessness</li>
                <li>Suggested reduction to level little more than animal</li>
                <li>Conversely: implied captors were humane people concerned about his welfare</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Stressed abjectness of Saddam Hussein + implicit suggestion of being well-cared for by captors. Image became <strong>narrative in itself</strong>, setting tone for what followed.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3.2 First Court Appearance (July 2004)</h3>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>The Clothing Theme: Cross-Cultural Thread</h3>

            <h4>Daily Telegraph (2 July 2004)</h4>
            <p>Half-page photograph of Saddam "slimmer and healthier," wearing "grey pinstriped jacket, brown trousers and shiny black shoes"</p>

            <h4>Corriere della Sera (19 October 2005 - trial start)</h4>
            <p>Headline: <strong>"Vestito scuro e il Corano tra le mani"</strong> (Dark suit and Koran in his hand)</p>
            <p>Dark suit denotes elegance/sobriety; Koran presented as prop to reinforce image of refinement/sincerity</p>

            <h4>Le Figaro (Same Date)</h4>
            <blockquote>
                "Vétu d'un costume sombre, le col de sa chemise blanche ouvert, Saddam Hussein, les cheveux mi-longs mais <strong>soigneusement teints</strong>, la barbe poivre et sel et les traits tirés, fait ses 68 ans."
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>'Soigneusement teints'</strong> (expertly dyed) implies vanity</p>

            <h4>The Times (30 November)</h4>
            <p>Story about Saddam's tailor, <strong>Recep Cesur</strong>, a Kurd from Istanbul who "has become the style guru to Middle East," supplying 50 new suits every second month</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Analysis of Clothing Theme</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cannot be traced to single source</strong> - cannot be said to have been directly translated</li>
                <li>Surfaced repeatedly as <strong>trope</strong></li>
                <li>Common means of signaling gap between appearances and reality</li>
                <li>Used as instrument of ridicule</li>
                <li>Shows first stage in <strong>theatricalization of sensational trial</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>3.3 The Sun's Theatrical Presentation</h3>

        <div class="case-study">
            <p>Front page prefigured theatricalization in layout:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two-thirds of page: photograph of unkempt, staring-eyed newly captured dictator</li>
                <li>Block capitals: <strong>"SADDAM CAPTURED"</strong></li>
                <li>Main headline (whole left side): <strong>"WE GOT HIM"</strong></li>
                <li>Above: familiar public address phrase "Ladies and gentlemen..."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> "WE GOT HIM" became "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him" - rhetorical device creating slightly comic tone. The Sun effectively presenting Saddam to public like old music-hall presenters introducing next act.</p>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h3>Martin Montgomery's Work on Princess Diana's Death (1997)</h3>

            <h4>Case Study: Three High-Profile BBC Broadcasts</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tony Blair</strong> (6 hours after news):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Television interview, open air, no notes, direct to camera</li>

            </table>

            <p><strong>Montgomery's argument:</strong> Speech in public sphere projects itself as valid by being perceived as true, sincere, or appropriate (or one or other of these three).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Speech Acts and Sincerity</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Montgomery (1999: 21) on Different Speech Acts:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                "Speech acts such as complimenting, apologizing and promising may be seen as <em>routinely</em> implicating sincerity. But speech acts such as commanding, requesting, passing sentence and excommunicating do not. A judge, for instance, may direct a trial jury to acquit but has to pass sentence on a defendant if a guilty verdict is reached: the sentence will be passed effectively, irrespective of the judge's emotional commitment to it. <strong>Promising, on the other hand, includes sincerity as a condition of its satisfactory performance.</strong>"

        <h3>Authentic Talk in the Public Sphere</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Montgomery (2001: 404) - Later Essay</h3>

            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> "Authentic talk" in public sphere</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Broadcast talk normally staged for performance in some way</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It is neither authority of speaker nor any sense of source being "authorized" that determines whether broadcast will be perceived as truthful, but rather <strong>"the nature and the manner of the talk itself that makes for compelling testimony"</strong></p>

            <h4>Implication</h4>
            <p>Validity of speech act assessed according to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diverse sign systems</li>
                <li>Contexts in which it is made and received</li>

        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Key Insight: Framing and Context Matter</h3>
            <p>"The human significance of speech resides not just in the way it means something propositionally in the here and now, but also in the ways it can be deemed valid (or invalid) in the here and now" (Montgomery, 1999: 12)</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In Diana tributes, speeches made immediately after death (Blair) or at funeral (Spencer) conveyed greater sense of validation than Queen's more formal broadcast after several days of media speculation about Buckingham Palace silence.</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Assessments of authenticity are both <strong>subjective</strong> and <strong>conditioned by context</strong> as well as body language, intonation, and vocabulary choice.</p>

            <h3>Process of Theatricalization</h3>

            <p>When interviews/debates/courtroom scenes laid out as though they were dramatic work, with names of speakers before each utterance:</p>

            <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Real-life exchange written up as though it were piece of theatre</p>

            <h4>Paradox:</h4>
            <p>Theatre perceived as intrinsically less authentic than news reporting, yet newspapers choose to set down events in dramatic text format</p>

            <p><strong>Why it deserves critical attention:</strong> Strategy utilized for particular end</p>

        <h2>6. Veracity and Domestication: Comparing Transcripts</h2>

        <h3>6.1 The Problem of Exact Translation</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Impossibility of Exact Translation</h3>
            <p>No translation can ever reproduce in identical format something written in another language - no two languages have identical semantic and syntactic patterns.</p>

            <h4>Example from Le Figaro:</h4>
            <p>"Saddam Hussein … <strong>fait ses 68 ans</strong>"</p>
            <p>Idiomatic expression translating as "looked all of his 68 years"</p>
            <p><strong>Has equivalent effect</strong> (Vermeer's skopos model) but <strong>by no means exact word-for-word translation</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>Central Question for News Translation</h3>
            <p>Variation is inevitable aspect of translation, but question always present: <strong>Is there a limit to extent of possible variation?</strong></p>

            <p>If variation is extreme that there is no trace of source text, can this still be said to be translation?</p>

            <p><strong>At heart of any discussion of news translation:</strong> Often only traceable source is an <em>event</em>, not any single identifiable textual account of that event. Source material is <strong>synthesized even as it is transferred across languages</strong>, then adjusted stylistically according to target culture norms.</p>

        <h3>6.2 July 2004 Court Transcripts: Independent vs Daily Telegraph</h3>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Publication of Transcripts</h3>

            <p>British papers carried transcripts of relatively brief appearance before judge - <strong>curiously theatrical gesture</strong></p>

            <h4>Intention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Convey heightened sense of veracity</li>
                <li>Invite readers to believe they're reading straightforward, unadulterated account</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Paradox:</h4>
            <p>Given theatricalization from moment of first images, publication of transcripts also served to enhance <strong>soap opera effect</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Daily Telegraph:</strong> "Saddam was not going to leave the stage without saying his piece" - theatrical dimension highlighted</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Implication:</strong> During hearing, journalists producing their own versions; when over, texts amalgamated with official transcript which didn't contain all exchanges recorded collectively</p>

            JUDGE: The head of the Baath Party that is dissolved, defunct. Former commander and chief of the army. Residence is Iraq. Your mother's name?<br>
            SADDAM: Sobha. You also have to introduce yourself to me.<br>
            JUDGE: Mr Saddam, I am the investigative judge of the central court of Iraq.<br>

            SADDAM: I am the president of the republic so you should not strip me of my title to put me on trial.<br>
            JUDGE: You are the ex-leader of Iraq and the ex-leader of the dissolved armed forces. Were you the leader of the Ba'ath party and head of the armed forces?<br>
            SADDAM: Yes. I've introduced myself to you but you haven't introduced yourself to me. So who are you?<br>

        <h2>7. Variations of Veracity: October 2005 Trial Transcripts</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Evolution of Reporting Strategy</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <p>Device of printing court transcripts diminished as trial progressed - doubtless because of extent of material, requiring more summary and comment.</p>

            <p><strong>Purpose served:</strong> Reproduction of transcripts served purpose in preliminary hearing and start of trial, establishing what was to unfold in <strong>theatricalized terms</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Transition:</strong> Supposedly verbatim exchanges gave way to articles written by journalists present in court</p>
        </div>

        <h3>7.2 Daily Telegraph Version (20 October 2005)</h3>

        <div class="case-study">

                JUDGE: Mr Saddam we ask you to write down your identity, your name, occupation and address and then we will allow you to talk. Now it is time to write down your identity.<br>
                SADDAM: First of all, who are you and what are you?<br>
                JUDGE: The Iraqi criminal court.<br>
                SADDAM: All of you are judges?<br>
                JUDGE: We don't have time to get into details. You can write down what you like.<br>
                SADDAM: I have been here in this military building since 2.30, and then from nine I have been wearing this suit. They have asked me to take it off and then put it on again many times.<br>
                SADDAM: [Continues with refusal to recognize court's authority]
            </div>

            <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Judge (named as Judge Amin) asks Saddam to "comunicare" (communicate/state) - far more general than English "write down"</li>

                <li><strong>For readers:</strong> Once we see differences between what purport to be accurate, truthful versions of same text, <strong>veracity of reporting of whole proceedings is called into question</strong></li>

                <li><strong>For translation analysts:</strong> Two texts create very different impression of event. If dramatized, actors would play very different roles depending on which script given</li>

                <li><strong>Character representation varies dramatically:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Telegraph: Blustering, rather coarse man</li>

                <li>If we have no Arabic, cannot check accuracy against published transcript in source language</li>
                <li>All we have: two English translations of <strong>composite transcript</strong> of court hearing in Arabic</li>
                <li>Both edited in different ways conforming to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Editorial policy of different newspapers</li>
                        <li>Expectations of readers</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>9. Truth, Appropriateness, and Sincerity as Culturally Determined</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Cultural Variability of Ethical Criteria</h3>

            <p>Truth, appropriateness, and sincerity are <strong>culturally determined</strong>, therefore <strong>variable</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Examples of Cultural Disparities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What passes as appropriate in one context may be deemed utterly inappropriate in another</li>
                <li>British use of irony and understatement would be highly inappropriate where hyperbole and assertiveness are norms</li>
                <li><strong>Only through translation do such disparities emerge</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Problem for Journalists</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <p>Part of problem faced by journalists writing up Saddam Hussein trial events derived from this disparity:</p>

            <p><strong>Some of his speeches in court:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acceptable in his own context</li>
                <li>Would have been read in very different light had they remained unedited</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Therefore, Editing Processes Were Multi-Layered:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Recognizing differences in cultural expectations</li>
                <li>Accommodating house style</li>
                <li>Accommodating ideological position of newspaper</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>At same time:</strong> Presentation of trial as <strong>global theatre</strong> determined what was offered to readers in different countries</p>

        <h2>10. Conclusion: Translation and the News</h2>

        <div class="important">
            <h3>What Is "Translation" in News Context?</h3>

            <p>Although we may use word 'translation' when referring to news translation, <strong>what happens during process of transfer is not translation as generally understood</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Why Journalists Object to Being Called Translators:</h4>
            <p>Prefer to refer to anyone who works across languages as <strong>"international journalist"</strong></p>

            <h4>The Process Explained:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bringing information out of one cultural context into another may involve element of interlingual transfer</li>
                <li><strong>BUT:</strong> Focus NOT on linguistic transferral</li>
                <li><strong>Focus IS on:</strong> Transposition of information in format aimed at meeting demands of target readership</li>
                <li>All kinds of additional textual processes beyond interlingual are involved</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether there is existing original text or journalist compiling report from variety of sources</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Absence of a Source Text</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Challenging the Definition of Translation</h3>

            <p><strong>Fact:</strong> There may not even be an original calls very idea of translation into question</p>

            <p><strong>Traditional definition:</strong> Translating involves transfer of text produced in one language into another</p>

            <p><strong>News reporting reality:</strong> Frequently what happens in news reporting <strong>cannot be defined as translation in this way</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Yet:</strong> Arguably there IS translation dimension when story that begins in one context is told, then retold for other readers in another language somewhere else</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Even With Source Text, Picture Remains Clouded</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <p>As we can see from examples of supposedly accurate translations from an original:</p>

            <p><strong>Variations are so great</strong> (result of various textual manipulations) that <strong>we have only loose grasp of what that original might have been</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Actually Happens in News Translation</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h3>The Real Process</h3>

            <p>Networks of foreign correspondents, working within or linked to news agencies, <strong>write and shape stories for designated audiences</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Mainly creation of <strong>completely new texts</strong>, which resist definition of translation</p>

            <h4>Power Inequalities</h4>
            <p>Domination of certain languages globally means power inequalities existing in wider socio-political arena <strong>manifest themselves in textual strategies</strong> employed by international journalists</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Study of Global News Translation Does</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Critical Awareness</h3>

            <p>Study of global news translation makes us all <strong>more aware</strong> of:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Manipulative processes</strong> that underlie what we read</li>
                <li><strong>Serious questions</strong> about extent to which we can ever know what was or was not said in another cultural context</li>
            </ol>
