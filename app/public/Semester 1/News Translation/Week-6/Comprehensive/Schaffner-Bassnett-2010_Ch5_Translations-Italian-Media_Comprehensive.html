            <div class="meta-info">
                <strong>Author:</strong> Federico Federici<br>
                <strong>Source:</strong> Schäffner & Bassnett (2010), Chapter 5<br>
                <strong>Focus:</strong> Critical Discourse Analysis, Translation as Political Practice, Media Manipulation

        <h2>1. Introduction: Translation and Power in Media Contexts</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Central Argument</h3>
            <p>Translation in news media is not a neutral act of linguistic transfer but a <strong>political practice</strong> that can legitimize particular interpretations of events, construct ideological narratives, and serve institutional power interests. This chapter analyzes how the U.S. military report on the death of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was translated and framed in Italian newspapers, demonstrating translation's role in political discourse and media manipulation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>On March 4, 2005, Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by U.S. forces at a checkpoint in Baghdad immediately after successfully negotiating the release of Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena. The incident provoked widespread anger in Italy and became a political flashpoint in debates about Italy's participation in the Iraq War.</p>

        <p>This chapter employs <strong>critical discourse analysis (CDA)</strong> to examine how translation choices, selective appropriation, and editorial framing constructed competing narratives about the Calipari incident in Italian media.</p>

        <h2>2. Theoretical Framework: Critical Discourse Analysis and Translation</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>What is CDA?</h3>
            <p>Critical discourse analysis is an analytical approach that examines how language constructs and maintains social relations, ideologies, and power structures. CDA assumes that discourse is never neutral but always shaped by and shapes social, political, and institutional contexts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Fairclough (1995, 2003) - Three Dimensions of Discourse</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Text:</strong> Linguistic and semiotic features of discourse</li>
                <li><strong>Discursive Practice:</strong> Processes of text production, distribution, and consumption</li>
                <li><strong>Social Practice:</strong> Broader social, political, and ideological contexts shaping and shaped by discourse</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Understanding discourse requires analyzing all three levels simultaneously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Van Dijk (1997) - Discourse and Ideology</h4>
            <p>Van Dijk emphasized the relationship between discourse and ideology, arguing that discourse serves to reproduce, legitimize, or challenge dominant ideologies. News discourse plays a crucial role in constructing "common sense" understandings that serve elite interests.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 CDA and Translation Studies</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Schäffner (2004) - Translation as Discursive Practice</h4>
            <p>Schäffner advocated integrating CDA with translation studies, arguing that translation is a form of discursive practice that can reinforce, challenge, or transform ideological meanings. Translation choices are never purely linguistic but reflect and construct ideological positions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Analyzing Translation Through CDA Requires Examining:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textual Shifts:</strong> How translation alters lexical choices, grammatical structures, rhetorical strategies</li>
                <li><strong>Selective Appropriation:</strong> Which elements of source texts are translated, highlighted, or omitted</li>
                <li><strong>Framing:</strong> How translated texts are contextualized through headlines, paratexts, editorial commentary</li>
                <li><strong>Intertextuality:</strong> How translated texts interact with other texts and discourses in target contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Social Function:</strong> What ideological work translation performs in specific political contexts</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Legitimized Texts</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Definition: Legitimized Texts</h3>
            <p>Legitimized texts are documents that possess institutional authority and credibility, often produced by state institutions, international organizations, or expert bodies. Translation of such texts into news media can serve to legitimize particular interpretations of events by invoking the authority of the source institution.</p>
            <p><strong>Critical Point:</strong> However, selective translation, reframing, and editorial manipulation can also appropriate legitimized texts to serve agendas opposed to the original text's intentions.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In the Calipari case, the U.S. military's official investigation report functioned as a legitimized text. Italian newspapers translated and quoted this report selectively to construct competing narratives—some defending U.S. actions, others condemning them.</p>

        <h2>3. The Italian Press Context</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Characteristics of Italian Media</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Political Alignment</h4>
            <p>Italian newspapers have traditionally maintained clear political orientations, explicitly aligning with particular parties, ideologies, or interest groups. This contrasts with Anglo-American journalistic ideals of objectivity and impartiality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Partisan Journalism</h4>
            <p>Italian journalists and newspapers openly advocate for political positions rather than pretending to neutrality. Readers understand newspapers' political leanings and select sources accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Political Instrumentalization</h4>
            <p>Media outlets are often owned by or closely connected to political actors, leading to explicit political instrumentalization of news coverage.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3.2 Italy and the Iraq War</h3>

        <p>The Calipari incident occurred within a contested political context:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Political Position</th>
                <th>Stance on Iraq War</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Berlusconi Government (Center-Right)</strong></td>
                <td>Supported U.S.-led invasion; maintained Italian military presence in Iraq</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Italian Public Opinion</strong></td>
                <td>Large majorities opposed the Iraq War</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Opposition Parties (Left-Wing)</strong></td>
                <td>Strongly criticized government support for U.S. policies</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Political Significance:</strong> The Calipari killing became not merely a tragic incident but a political flashpoint. Media coverage served as a proxy for broader debates about Italy's foreign policy, relationship with the United States, and the Iraq War's legitimacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. The Calipari Incident: Background</h2>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>The Events of March 4, 2005</h3>
            <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Nicola Calipari, a senior Italian intelligence officer (SISMI), successfully negotiated the release of Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist kidnapped in Baghdad on February 4, 2005. After securing her release, Calipari accompanied Sgrena and an Italian driver in a vehicle heading to Baghdad Airport. At a U.S. military checkpoint, American soldiers opened fire on the vehicle. Calipari threw himself over Sgrena to protect her and was killed instantly. Sgrena and the driver were wounded but survived.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4.1 Conflicting Accounts</h3>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Account</th>
                <th>Key Claims</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>U.S. Military</strong></td>
                <td>Vehicle speeding toward checkpoint; soldiers followed rules of engagement</td>
                <td>Speed: 80-100 km/h; warning signals ignored; shooting justified</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Italian Survivors (Sgrena)</strong></td>
                <td>Vehicle traveling slowly; no warning signals; shooting sudden and unjustified</td>
                <td>Slow speed; checkpoint poorly marked; no warnings given</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>4.2 The U.S. Military Report</h3>

        <p>In April 2005, the U.S. military released its official investigation report. The report:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Concluded that U.S. soldiers followed appropriate rules of engagement</li>
            <li>Found no wrongdoing or criminal negligence by American forces</li>
            <li>Attributed the incident to miscommunication and failure of the Italian vehicle to heed warning signals</li>
            <li>Recommended no disciplinary action against U.S. soldiers</li>
            <li>Was partially redacted, with sections censored for security reasons</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This report became the central <strong>legitimized text</strong> that Italian media translated, interpreted, and deployed in constructing narratives about the incident.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Italian Reactions</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Public Outrage</h4>
            <p>The incident provoked widespread anger in Italy. Calipari was mourned as a national hero, and his funeral drew massive attendance including the President of Italy. Public sentiment strongly condemned the U.S. military action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Political Pressure</h4>
            <p>Opposition parties demanded Italian withdrawal from Iraq and sharply criticized the Berlusconi government's alliance with the United States. The incident intensified political polarization around the Iraq War.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Translation Analysis: How Italian Press Framed the U.S. Report</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Methodology</h3>

        <p>Federici analyzed how major Italian newspapers translated and framed excerpts from the U.S. military report, focusing on:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Which portions of the report were translated and published</li>
            <li><strong>Translation Choices:</strong> How specific terms and phrases were rendered in Italian</li>
            <li><strong>Paratextual Framing:</strong> Headlines, subheadings, and editorial commentary</li>
            <li><strong>Intertextual References:</strong> How translations were juxtaposed with other sources</li>
            <li><strong>Ideological Function:</strong> What political work the translation performed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5.2 Patterns of Selective Appropriation</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Pro-Government/Pro-U.S. Newspapers</h3>
            <p>Conservative newspapers aligned with the Berlusconi government tended to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translate sections emphasizing procedural correctness of U.S. soldiers' actions</li>
                <li>Quote conclusions exonerating American forces from wrongdoing</li>
                <li>Frame translations with headlines emphasizing miscommunication rather than culpability</li>
                <li>Minimize translation of critical assessments or inconsistencies</li>
                <li>Use translation to legitimate U.S. version by invoking report's institutional authority</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Opposition/Critical Newspapers</h3>
            <p>Left-wing and opposition newspapers tended to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translate sections revealing inconsistencies, contradictions, or gaps in U.S. account</li>
                <li>Highlight redacted portions to suggest cover-up</li>
                <li>Frame translations with headlines emphasizing U.S. responsibility or injustice</li>
                <li>Juxtapose translated report excerpts with Sgrena's contradictory testimony</li>
                <li>Use translation to delegitimize U.S. report by exposing its limitations and biases</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Critical Insight</h4>
            <p>The same legitimized text (U.S. report) was selectively translated and framed to support diametrically opposed political narratives. Translation functioned not as neutral transfer but as <strong>ideological weapon</strong> in political struggle.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5.3 Lexical Choices and Ideological Positioning</h3>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>English Term</th>
                <th>Translation A (Pro-Government)</th>
                <th>Translation B (Opposition)</th>
                <th>Ideological Effect</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Engagement"</td>
                <td><em>Ingaggio</em><br>(neutral military term)</td>
                <td><em>Scontro a fuoco</em><br>(firefight - emphasizes violence)</td>
                <td>A normalizes; B emphasizes aggression</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Incident"</td>
                <td><em>Incidente</em><br>(accident, mishap)</td>
                <td><em>Uccisione</em><br>(killing - deliberate act)</td>
                <td>A minimizes; B emphasizes responsibility</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Rules of engagement"</td>
                <td><em>Regole d'ingaggio</em><br>(technical term)</td>
                <td><em>Procedure di apertura del fuoco</em><br>(procedures for opening fire)</td>
                <td>A technical/neutral; B emphasizes violence</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Pro-government newspapers favored Option A translations, while opposition newspapers favored Option B, demonstrating how lexical choices construct ideological positions.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Reframing Through Headlines</h3>

        <p>Even when newspapers translated identical report passages, headlines and editorial framing constructed opposed meanings:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Pro-Government Headline:</strong> "U.S. Report Confirms Soldiers Followed Procedures; Tragedy Result of Miscommunication"
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Opposition Headline:</strong> "U.S. Report Fails to Explain Killing; Contradictions Suggest Cover-Up"
        </blockquote>

        <p>Both headlines referenced the same translated report, but framing directed readers toward opposite interpretations.</p>

        <h3>5.5 Selective Quotation and Omission</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Strategic Selection:</strong> Newspapers did not translate the entire report but selectively quoted passages supporting their editorial positions while omitting contradictory elements. This selective appropriation transformed the report's meaning despite claiming to faithfully translate official findings.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5.6 Translation as Legitimization Strategy</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Legitimizing U.S. Account (Pro-Government Press)</h3>
            <p>Translation of the U.S. report invoked institutional authority to legitimate American version of events. By presenting translated official findings, newspapers constructed U.S. account as authoritative "truth," marginalizing alternative narratives (particularly Sgrena's testimony). Translation thus served to legitimize both U.S. military action and Italian government's continued alliance with the United States.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Delegitimizing U.S. Account (Opposition Press)</h3>
            <p>Strategic translation highlighting inconsistencies and gaps served to delegitimize U.S. report. By emphasizing redactions, contradictions, and discrepancies between report and Sgrena's account, translation exposed the report's limitations and ideological biases. This delegitimization supported calls for Italian withdrawal from Iraq and condemnation of U.S. military practices.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Theoretical Implications</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Translation as Political Practice</h3>

            <p><strong>Beyond Linguistic Transfer:</strong> The case study demonstrates that translation in news media cannot be understood as merely linguistic transfer. Translation is a <strong>political practice</strong> embedded in power relations, ideological struggles, and institutional contexts. Translation choices reflect and construct political positions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6.2 The Politics of Legitimized Texts</h3>

        <p>Legitimized texts do not automatically impose their authority when translated into new contexts:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Legitimized texts can be selectively appropriated to serve opposing agendas</li>
            <li>Translation can either reinforce or subvert the authority of legitimized texts</li>
            <li>The same legitimized text can be translated to support contradictory political narratives</li>
            <li>Institutional authority must be actively constructed through framing and contextualization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Multi-Level Analysis</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Integrating CDA with Translation Studies</h4>
            <p>Examining translation requires attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textual features:</strong> Lexical choices, grammatical structures</li>
                <li><strong>Discursive practices:</strong> Selection, framing, intertextuality</li>
                <li><strong>Social contexts:</strong> Political polarization, media ecology, power relations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All three levels must be analyzed to understand how translation operates ideologically.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>6.4 Translation as Manipulation</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>When Does Translation Become Manipulation?</h3>
            <p>While all translation involves transformation, the Calipari case reveals translation as deliberate manipulation when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selection is strategically deployed to misrepresent source texts</li>
                <li>Framing contradicts or distorts translated content</li>
                <li>Institutional authority is invoked while content is selectively appropriated</li>
                <li>Translation serves explicit political agendas while claiming objectivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This raises ethical questions about translation's responsibility in political discourse and news media.</p>

        <h2>7. Broader Significance</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Translation in Asymmetric Power Relations</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Hegemonic Discourse</h4>
            <p>The U.S. military report, written in English by the dominant military power, functioned as a hegemonic text. Italian media's translation and negotiation of this text reflected Italy's subordinate position within U.S.-led alliances and broader global power structures. Translation became a site where Italian media contested or accommodated U.S. hegemony.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>7.2 Translation and National Identity</h3>

        <p>The intense Italian public reaction reflected how the incident became symbolically linked to Italian national identity and sovereignty:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Calipari as national hero embodied Italian values (sacrifice, duty, humanitarianism)</li>
            <li>The killing was experienced as violation of Italian sovereignty and dignity</li>
            <li>Media coverage invoked national solidarity against perceived American arrogance</li>
            <li>Translation of U.S. report became proxy for asserting or defending national interests</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.3 Translation Ethics</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Ethical Questions Raised by This Case:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> What ethical responsibilities do translators and media organizations have when translating politically sensitive texts?</li>
                <li><strong>Manipulation:</strong> When does strategic selection and framing cross the line from legitimate editorial practice to manipulative distortion?</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Should news media be more transparent about translation processes and editorial decisions?</li>
                <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> In politically polarized contexts, is objective translation possible or even desirable?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Translation as Political Practice:</strong> Translation in news media is not neutral linguistic transfer but political practice embedded in power relations and ideological struggles.</li>

                <li><strong>Selective Appropriation:</strong> The same legitimized text was selectively translated to support diametrically opposed political narratives in the Calipari case.</li>

                <li><strong>Competing Legitimization:</strong> Translation served both to legitimize and delegitimize the U.S. account. Legitimized texts do not automatically impose authority when translated.</li>

                <li><strong>CDA's Value:</strong> Critical discourse analysis provides valuable tools for analyzing translation's ideological functions through multi-level examination.</li>

                <li><strong>Media Context Matters:</strong> Italian press's partisan tradition and Italy's contested relationship with U.S. foreign policy shaped how translation functioned.</li>

                <li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> The case raises important questions about translation ethics, media responsibility, and the relationship between translation and manipulation.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>The Calipari case is not exceptional but exemplary, revealing broader patterns in how translation operates in globalized media landscapes. As international news increasingly relies on translation, understanding translation's political dimensions becomes crucial for media literacy and critical citizenship.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Translation is always an act of rewriting, and in the political arena, rewriting is invariably ideological. The Calipari case demonstrates how translation becomes a weapon in political struggle, a tool for legitimization and delegitimization, a site where national identities are asserted and international power relations are contested."
        </blockquote>

        <p>By revealing how translation served competing political agendas, this chapter equips readers to critically examine translation in their own media consumption, recognizing that translated news is never simply "the facts" but always politically constructed representation.</p>
