        <h2>Introduction: Historical and Institutional Context</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Origins of European Integration (1957)</h4>
            <p>Political and ideological movement born from ravages of two world wars. Six European countries met in Rome to sign treaties establishing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>European Economic Community (EEC)</li>
                <li>European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Original Goal (Robert Schuman, 1950):</strong> Secure lasting peace by pooling industries and technologies essential for warfare (coal and steel).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Revolutionary Organizing Principle</h4>
            <p>Countries would <strong>give up some sovereign powers</strong> and place them under independent authority (first: European Coal and Steel Community, 1951).</p>
            <p><strong>Why revolutionary?</strong> Historically, European countries managed relations through bilateral agreements or multilateral summits (Congress of Vienna 1814), but NEVER willingly ceded sovereign powers for common good.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Principle of Equality</h3>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Core Innovation</h4>
            <p>Congress of Vienna system (1814-1914) was structurally flawed: deals inevitably biased toward larger, more powerful countries at expense of minor powers.</p>
            <p><strong>EU Innovation:</strong> Based on <strong>principle of equality</strong>. Within treaty limits, ALL countries that joined EU enjoy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Same rights</li>
                <li>Same duties</li>
                <li>Fair representation in common institutions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Creation of independent bodies with mandate to defend/promote common good opened "a clearing in international law, which had been a Hobbesian jungle until then."</p>

        <h3>Language in Original Treaties</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Original treaties did NOT include any provision related to language among articles devoted to Community tasks. Tasks focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common economic goals (internal market, growth, jobs)</li>
                <li>Social and environmental protection</li>
                <li>Social cohesion and solidarity</li>
                <li>Equality between men and women</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Legal Basis of EU Language Policy</h2>

        <h3>Article 21 (TEC)</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Citizen Communication Rights</h4>
            <p class="quote">"Every citizen of the Union may write to any of [its] institutions or bodies [...] in one of the languages mentioned in Article 314 and have an answer in the same language."</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> EU institutions are <strong>multilingual bodies</strong>. To author's knowledge, NO other international/supranational organization is mandated by foundational law to interact with constituents in languages they understand.</p>
            <p><strong>Closer to:</strong> Arrangements in multilingual countries (Belgium, Canada, South Africa).</p>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Law cannot give preferential treatment to any language lest discrimination be legalized.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Use of verb "write" presupposes official exchanges between institutions and natural/legal persons. Language regarded as <strong>operational and administrative issue</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Article 314 (TEC)</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Equally Authentic Languages</h4>
            <p class="quote">"This Treaty, drawn up in a single original in the Dutch, French, German, and Italian languages, all four texts being equally authentic, shall be deposited [...]"</p>
            <p><strong>Original:</strong> Four languages (1957)</p>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> Amended several times, now includes 23 languages</p>
            <p><strong>"Equally authentic":</strong> Intriguing phrase reaffirming principle of equality - different language versions are equally authentic.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Article 290 (TEC)</h3>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Decision-Making on Languages</h4>
            <p class="quote">"The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall [...] be determined by the Council, acting unanimously."</p>
            <p><strong>Crucial implications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Languages absent from original policies of Community</li>
                <li>ANY decision regarding languages taken by Council (representatives of member state governments)</li>
                <li>Each government has <strong>VETO POWER</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Council Regulation No. 1 of 1958</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>First Regulation Adopted</h4>
            <p>Although languages regarded as mere administrative challenge, solving it was <strong>precondition</strong> for newly established institutions to work at all.</p>
            <p><strong>Article 1:</strong> "The official languages and the working languages of the institutions of the Community shall be Dutch, French, German and Italian."</p>
            <p><strong>Article 3:</strong> "Documents which an institution of the Community sends to a Member State or to a person subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State shall be drafted in the language of such State."</p>
            <p><strong>Confirms:</strong> Official languages of European institutions coincide with official languages of member countries.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Official and Working Languages</h2>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Distinction and Challenge</h4>
            <p>Regulation uses both terms - "official and working languages" - but makes <strong>NO distinction</strong> between them (van Els 2005; Ammon 2006).</p>
            <p><strong>When 4 languages:</strong> Distinction not crucial</p>
            <p><strong>Today (23 languages):</strong> Potentially major difficulty - unrealistic to expect such linguistic prowess of EU officials</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Practical Arrangements</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Internal Communication Reality</h4>
            <p>When EU staff talk/write to each other, they normally use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>French</strong> or <strong>English</strong></li>
                <li>German a distant third</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> <strong>Passive bilingualism</strong> not uncommon - people comprehend both French and English perfectly but prefer one for writing/speaking.</p>
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> EU institutions home to people from 27 nationalities using mainly TWO languages to communicate, and for large majority NEITHER is mother tongue.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>EU Institutional Culture</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Koskinen (2000, 2004)</h4>
            <p>Claims that <strong>EU institutions form a culture of their own</strong>. Author's observations confirm this insight.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is position of EU institutional culture vis-à-vis cultures of its constituencies?</li>
                <li>Is it a melting pot? An interculture (Pym 2002)? An ivory tower detached from real world?</li>
                <li>What about citizens' participation and democratic legitimacy?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Stakes:</strong> Interface between EU institutional culture and cultures across continent potentially affects democratic legitimacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>More Recent Developments</h2>

        <h3>Treaty of Maastricht (1992, entered force 1993)</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Article 149 (ex Article 126)</h4>
            <p class="quote">"Community action shall be aimed at: developing the European dimension in education, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the Member States."</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Short point, hardly basis for comprehensive policy, language only mentioned via education. HOWEVER, <strong>languages ceased to be entirely administrative issue</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Constitutional Treaty (2004) - Rejected but Influential</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Article I-10: Citizenship Right</h4>
            <p class="quote">"(d) the right to petition the European Parliament, to apply to the European Ombudsman, and to address the Institutions and advisory bodies of the Union in any of the Constitution's languages and to obtain a reply in the same language."</p>
            <p><strong>Evolution:</strong> Using one's language with EU institutions stated as <strong>citizenship right</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Article II-101: Right to Good Administration</h4>
            <p class="quote">"4. Every citizen may write to the Institutions of the Union in one of the languages of the Constitution and must have an answer in the same language."</p>
            <p><strong>Preserves:</strong> Traditional view - language rights part of citizen's right to good administration.</p>
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> EU charter of fundamental rights of 2000 (mentioned language as grounds for prohibited discrimination).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The "Equally Authentic" Paradox</h3>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Author's Theoretical Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Most important theoretical feature:</strong> Phrase "equally authentic"</p>

            <p><strong>Two interpretations:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Focus on "equally":</strong> No matter which language text drafted in, that language has NO higher status than languages into which it was translated</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on "authenticity":</strong> Although all versions but one must be translations, they are NOT to be regarded as such</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Reason for Interpretation #2:</strong> Prevent EU's primary legal text being weakened by translation</p>

            <p><strong>Potential Problems without "authentic" clause:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translated article could be challenged in court for not "saying the same" thing as original</li>
                <li>Easy to make claim, devilishly difficult to settle</li>
                <li>Ruthless lawyers could freeze trials about to lose</li>
                <li>Could make European law difficult to implement</li>
                <li>Nationalist politicians might object to theirs being language INTO which legislation translated (given lower social/cultural status of translations across Europe)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Implicit View:</strong> Translation as <strong>corrupting operation producing second-rate texts</strong> - not made explicit but merely implied in primary legislation</p>

            <p><strong>Power of Implicit Communication:</strong> When you use inferential processes to extract implicit views from text, becomes more difficult to formulate critical response - inference located in your mind, not in text before eyes - somehow already belongs to you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Community vs Inter-Governmental Methods</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Current State</h4>
            <p>Treaties in force and Reform Treaty under ratification <strong>leave area of languages to Member States</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Little room for administrative decisions at community level</li>
                <li>Even less room for policy-making</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> NOT to imply Commission/Parliament should take over. Many excellent reasons why national authorities should keep tight grip on languages.</p>
            <p><strong>However:</strong> Legislation and policies should keep pace with changes in body politic and social.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Three Major Changes in European Linguistic Landscape</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>1. Migration</h4>
            <p>Europe has become sought-after destination for migrants from poorer regions. Together with their ability/willingness to work (propping up economy threatened by ageing population), they add customs and languages to cultural and human diversity of Europe.</p>

            <h4>2. Erasmus Generations and Internal Mobility</h4>
            <p>Never been so easy to move to another EU country for study/work. Progressive dismantling of internal barriers. Increased mobility may not enrich diversity but will <strong>mix existing palette to create new colors</strong>.</p>

            <h4>3. Devolution to Regions</h4>
            <p>Growing demand in certain countries for devolution of central powers to regions. Linked to success of EU as institutional model - created alternative to monopoly position of "the nation [as] an imagined political community" (Anderson 1991:5).</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> European citizens of tomorrow likely to feel <strong>multiple, equally strong allegiances</strong> toward own regions, countries, and united Europe. Regional languages may acquire higher status.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Inter-Governmental Example: Co-Official Languages Debate (2004)</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Spain vs France</h4>
            <p>According to Spanish press (ABC, La Razón 18 May 2004), during final conference approving Constitution:</p>
            <p><strong>Spain requested:</strong> Recognition of "co-official languages" in constitutional treaty</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent with trends granting regions autonomy, including use of regional languages (Catalan, Galician, Basque)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>France opposed:</strong> Consistent with traditional French-only policy (e.g., "loi Toubon" 1994 making French compulsory in all advertising)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Resulting Article IV-448(2)</h4>

            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Would have allowed Madrid to have European Constitution exist in languages other than Castilian.</p>

        <h2>A Policy Document on Multilingualism (2005)</h2>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Three Events Marking Ascent of Multilingualism Policy</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>2004:</strong> Inclusion of multilingualism in portfolio of Commissioner Figel' (alongside education, culture, youth, sport)</li>
                <li><strong>November 2005:</strong> Publication of communication "A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism"</li>
                <li><strong>1 January 2007:</strong> Language policies became entire/sole responsibility of newly appointed Romanian Commissioner Leonard Orban</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Communication: "A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism" (2005)</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>First Comprehensive Policy Document</h4>
            <p>Followed 2003 communication "Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004-2006"</p>

            <h4>Terminological Issues</h4>
            <p>Defined "multilingualism" THREE ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"A person's ability to use several languages"</li>
                <li>"The co-existence of different language communities in one geographical area"</li>
                <li>"The new field of Commission policy that promotes a climate conducive to full expression of all languages, in which teaching and learning of variety of languages can flourish"</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Overstretched term. Would have been preferable to use distinct terms to keep referents apart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Policy Aims</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity</li>
                <li>Promoting the multilingual economy</li>
                <li>Making EU legislation available in official languages of Union</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Practical Upshots</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advisory panel:</strong> Independent experts to analyze progress, suggest new initiatives</li>
                <li><strong>Ministerial conference:</strong> EU countries share experiences, plan future work</li>
                <li><strong>Future development:</strong> Commission would use input from expert group and national authorities to develop approach</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Openness, involvement, careful policy design (contrast with 2004 negotiations behind closed doors)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Content Beyond Administrative Challenge</h4>
            <p>Clearly tried to go beyond traditional view of multilingualism as administrative challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>Recognition:</strong> Language domain much broader; multilingualism crucial for long-term success of European integration.</p>

            <p><strong>Traditional positions maintained:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on language learning</li>
                <li><strong>"English is not enough"</strong> orientation (learning foreign language should not necessarily mean learning English alone)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>New element:</strong> Focus on <strong>economic impact of languages</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Part 1: Wealth directly generated by language/mediation skills (e.g., localization industry)</li>
                <li>Part 2: What public authorities can/should do to assist continental economy becoming increasingly multilingual</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Remarks: Three Important Aspects</h2>

        <h3>1. Language Services of EU Institutions</h3>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Most Developed Part of Multilingualism</h4>
            <p>Ability to ensure communication in all official languages is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prerequisite for proper functioning of institutions</li>
                <li>Essential for <strong>democratic legitimacy</strong> of Union</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Citizens and institutions must understand legal documents and relevant information in their language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Which Institutions Have Language Services?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Council</li>
                <li>Parliament</li>
                <li>Court of Justice</li>
                <li>Economic and Social Committee</li>
                <li>Committee of the Regions</li>
                <li>Court of Auditors</li>
                <li>European Commission</li>
                <li>European Investment Bank</li>
                <li>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</li>
                <li>European Central Bank</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Translation Centre (Luxembourg):</strong> Takes care of remaining bodies and agencies</p>
            <p><strong>Directorate General for Interpretation:</strong> Covers interpretation on inter-institutional basis (except Parliament and Court of Justice which have own services)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>DGT - Directorate General for Translation (Commission)</h4>
            <p><strong>By far the largest service</strong></p>
            <p><strong>February 2007 statistics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2,300 staff total</li>
                <li>1,700 full-time translators</li>
                <li>Rest: support staff</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2006 output:</strong> Over 1.5 million pages (about 20% translated by freelancers)</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. English Only? Language Learning Policy</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Commission Recommendation</h4>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Each European citizen should speak <strong>TWO foreign languages</strong> apart from mother tongue</p>
            <p><strong>"Mother tongue plus two"</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Why Not Just One Language?</h4>
            <p><strong>Answer from opening chapter:</strong> EU respects, fosters, and is based on <strong>DIVERSITY</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Comparison to US:</strong></p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>USA</th>
                        <th>EU</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>English-only tradition</td>
                        <td>Multilingual diversity</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Melting pot</strong> - people give up languages to integrate</td>
                        <td><strong>Welding</strong> - pieces welded together, each clearly recognizable as distinct</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Language Barriers vs Diversity</h4>
            <p>Praise of diversity should NOT prevent Europeans from having some languages in common.</p>
            <p><strong>Language barriers hinder:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free circulation of capital, people, goods, services</li>
                <li>Political, social, cultural integration</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Co-ordinated effort to teach other European languages since earliest years of schooling</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Determining WHICH language(s) should be taught</p>
            <p><strong>Current situation:</strong> No co-ordinated explicit orientation for whole EU. Whatever de facto policies exist = sum of member state policies.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>English Dominance Debate</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Two Extreme Views (Both Wrong)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> English as natural lingua franca of Europe and world</li>
                <li><strong>Con:</strong> English as demonized symbol of negative impact of globalization</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Eurobarometer 2006 Data</h4>
            <p><strong>Finding:</strong> English most popular foreign language spoken across EU (38% of non-English-speaking Europeans claim they can hold conversation)</p>

            <p><strong>However:</strong> NOT a behemoth as sometimes portrayed</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many Europeans (especially in smaller countries) familiar with languages of larger neighbors</li>
                <li><strong>German</strong> popular in: Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia</li>
                <li><strong>Italian</strong> popular in: Malta, Croatia</li>
                <li><strong>Russian</strong> popular in: Former Baltic Republics, Bulgaria</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> "Mother tongue plus two" corresponds to <strong>many-centered Europe</strong> where significant number already learn English PLUS neighbor's language</p>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Author's Caveats</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Read data carefully:</strong> No such thing as enough information on language behaviour/perceptions for policy makers</li>
                <li><strong>Design carefully:</strong> Common language policy should be accurately designed around existing trends and <strong>as unobtrusive as possible</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Avoid top-down:</strong> Attempts by public authorities to promote top-down language policies associated with totalitarian/undemocratic regimes (Franco's Spain, Mussolini's Italy)</li>
                <li><strong>Worst examples today:</strong> Assimilation policies discouraging minority languages in Afghanistan, Burma, Indonesia, Iraq (none paragons of democracy)</li>
                <li><strong>Languages = identity:</strong> Languages intertwined with affirmation/identification of personal and community identities. People would resist abrupt policies or reject as undue intrusions into most private thoughts/feelings</li>
                <li><strong>Main point:</strong> Go along with observed language behaviour; involve as many people as possible in all stages using transparent/accessible platforms</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Promoting Linguistic Diversity</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Evolution of Concept</h4>
            <p><strong>Traditional focus:</strong> Large non-national and co-official regional languages (e.g., Welsh, Catalan)</p>
            <p><strong>Increasingly means:</strong> Dealing with weaker/smaller aboriginal language minorities AND languages of migrants</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Complexity of Diversity</h4>
            <p><strong>Eurobarometer data insights:</strong> In several countries, many respondents indicated national language as NOT their mother tongue</p>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spain:</strong> 1 in 10 indicated Castilian as main foreign language (probably native speakers of regional languages)</li>
                <li><strong>Germany:</strong> Similar proportion recorded (probably immigrants born abroad)</li>
                <li><strong>Turkey:</strong> 7% indicated Turkish as foreign language (belonged to one of 34 language communities listed by SIL International)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Scale of Linguistic Diversity</h4>
            <p><strong>Aboriginal languages in EU:</strong> About 90 (Gordon 2005)</p>
            <p><strong>Migrant languages:</strong> DWARF aboriginal languages in number</p>

            <p><strong>Example - British National Centre for Languages Survey (2004-05):</strong></p>
            <p>As many as <strong>273 languages</strong> spoken by school children in England, Wales and Scotland</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Policy Imperatives</h4>
            <p>ANY language policy should <strong>protect and help develop ALL languages spoken within EU borders</strong> irrespective of being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>National</li>
                <li>Regional/minority</li>
                <li>Migrant languages</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Priority:</strong> If EU to keep mission to "respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity" (TEC I-3(3)), should give priority to language communities that MOST need tangible and symbolic support</p>
        </div>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>High Stakes</h4>
            <p>Much at stake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Migrant families:</strong> Language and culture tensions common, especially as young generations born/raised in Europe grow up</li>
                <li><strong>Indigenous communities:</strong> Similar tensions affect communities, embitter inter-cultural relations</li>
                <li><strong>Major challenge:</strong> Poised to become major stumbling blocks for successful integration of newly arrived Europeans and for balanced/peaceful development of societies</li>
