        <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
        <div class="chapter-divider">Chapter 1: Background & Theory</div>

        <h2>Definition & Core Concepts</h2>

        <div class="question-box">
            <h4>Question 1</h4>
            <p>Define Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and explain its main objectives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is the systematic study of how language is used to persuade, manipulate, and control individuals and social groups. It focuses on language as a controlling force in society and its role in maintaining or changing social structures.</p>
            <p><strong>Main Objectives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Practical:</strong> Analyze discourse practices that reflect/construct social problems; investigate how ideologies become "frozen" in language; increase awareness to address injustice and power misuse</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical:</strong> Demonstrate language's significance in power relations; investigate how meaning is created in context; examine the role of speaker/writer purpose and authorial stance</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Goals:</strong> Develop awareness of language and ideology; understand how discourse controls society; question conventional discourses; work towards social justice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-box">
            <h4>Question 2</h4>
            <p>What is the difference between "critical" in CDA and "critical" in everyday usage? Why is this distinction important?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Everyday usage:</strong> "Critical" often means negative evaluation or fault-finding.</p>
            <p><strong>In CDA:</strong> "Critical" means <em>critique</em> — systematic analysis that can be positive OR negative. For example, CDA can analyze successful resistance movements (positive) just as well as oppressive propaganda (negative).</p>
            <p><strong>Why important:</strong> This distinction is crucial because CDA is not about negativity — it's about examining underlying structures, assumptions, and power relations in ANY discourse. The goal is understanding and awareness, not judgment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-box">

            <h4>Question 6</h4>
            <p>Define "ideology" and "frames" in the context of CDA. How are they related?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> A set of beliefs and attitudes shared by a social group, often <em>unconscious</em> and taken for granted. Ideologies can be hidden in single words (e.g., "democracy," "freedom," "collateral damage").</p>
            <p><strong>Frames:</strong> Mental structures that shape how we see the world (concept from George Lakoff). Frames are triggered by words and are culture-specific cognitive models. Example: "cricket" triggers a frame including pitch, bat, ball, umpire, wicket.</p>
            <p><strong>Relationship:</strong> Frames are the building blocks of ideology. When certain frames are repeatedly activated (e.g., "immigrants as flood/invasion"), they shape ideological worldviews. Ideologies are maintained through the consistent use of certain frames.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-box">
            <h4>Question 7</h4>
            <p>What does "making strange" mean in CDA? Why is it an important analytical skill?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> "Making strange" is the practice of observing familiar customs as an outsider would — stepping back from normalized practices to see them with fresh eyes.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps identify practices that have become so familiar they seem "natural"</li>
                <li>Reveals hidden power relations in everyday discourse</li>
                <li>Enables denormalization of problematic practices</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Traditional marriage vows required women to "obey and serve" — this was so normalized it seemed unremarkable. "Making strange" revealed the gender inequality, leading to change.</p>

        <h2>Context & Meaning</h2>

        <div class="question-box">
            <h4>Question 8</h4>
            <p>Explain the relationship between sign, context, and meaning. Provide examples.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> Meaning is created when a sign occurs in a specific context. The same sign can have completely different meanings in different contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red flag on beach:</strong> Danger/no swimming</li>
                <li><strong>Red flag at demonstration:</strong> Political symbol (socialism)</li>
                <li><strong>Cross (X) on student work:</strong> Error/incorrect</li>
                <li><strong>Cross (X) on ballot:</strong> Selection/vote</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Signs don't carry fixed meanings — context determines meaning.</p>

            <p>What are performatives? What conditions must be met for them to work?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Performatives are utterances that IS an act of doing something — the words themselves perform the action simply by being spoken.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> "I promise...", "I bet...", "I pronounce you husband and wife", "I sentence you to..."</p>
            <p><strong>Conditions (Felicity Conditions):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The speaker must have the <strong>authority</strong> to perform the act</li>
                <li>The <strong>circumstances</strong> must be appropriate</li>
                <li>The proper <strong>procedures</strong> must be followed</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example of failure:</strong> "I pronounce you husband and wife" said by an actor in a play does NOT perform a marriage because the conditions aren't met.</p>

            <p><strong>Importance for CDA:</strong> CDA focuses on <em>sense</em> because the same words with the same dictionary meaning can carry very different ideological messages in context. Example: "terrorist" vs. "freedom fighter" might refer to the same group but carry opposite senses.</p>

            <p>What is implicature? How does it rely on the Co-operative Principle?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-box">
            <h4>Answer</h4>
            <p><strong>Implicature:</strong> Meaning that is evident although not explicitly stated — "reading between the lines."</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Implicature relies on the assumption that speakers are following the Co-operative Principle. When something seems to violate a maxim, we look for an implied meaning that makes the utterance cooperative.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A:</strong> "Is John a good student?"</li>
                <li><strong>B:</strong> "He attends class regularly."</li>
                <li><strong>Implicature:</strong> B didn't directly answer, only mentioning attendance. We infer that's all B can positively say — implying John is NOT particularly good academically.</li>
