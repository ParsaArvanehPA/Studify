                Verse 94 & Verses 105-109: Divine Tests, Personal Responsibility, and the Law of Testimony<br>

        <h2>Introduction to Surah Al-Ma'idah</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Overview of the Surah</h4>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Al-Ma'idah (المائدة) - "The Table Spread"</p>
            <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Medinan Surah</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Verses:</strong> 120 verses</p>
            <p><strong>Position:</strong> Fifth chapter of the Quran</p>
            <p><strong>Central Themes:</strong> Fulfilling obligations, dietary laws, pilgrimage regulations, interfaith relations, testimony and justice, and the story of Jesus and his disciples</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Historical Context:</strong> This is one of the last chapters revealed in Medina, containing final legislations and guidelines for the Muslim community. The verses we study today address two critical areas: divine testing through seemingly simple commandments (v.94) and the intricate laws of testimony and witness (v.105-109).
        </div>

        <h2>Verse 94: The Test Through Hunting</h2>

        <div class="arabic-text">
            <span class="verse-number">94</span>
            يا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ اللَّـهُ بِشَيْ‏ءٍ مِنَ الصَّيْدِ تَنالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَ رِماحُكُمْ لِيَعْلَمَ اللَّـهُ مَنْ يَخافُهُ بِالْغَيْبِ فَمَنِ اعْتَدى‏ بَعْدَ ذلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذابٌ أَلِيمٌ
        </div>

        <div class="translation-box">
            <h4>Translation:</h4>
            <p>"O you who have believed, Allah will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears can reach, so that Allah may make evident those who fear Him unseen. And whoever transgresses after that - for him is a painful punishment."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Context and Background</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>The Situation</h4>
            <p>This verse was revealed during the context of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (6 AH / 628 CE), when Muslims were in a state of <em>ihram</em> (ritual consecration) for pilgrimage. During ihram, hunting game is strictly prohibited.</p>

            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The pilgrims passed through areas with abundant wildlife - animals so tame and plentiful that they could be caught by hand or easily speared. Yet despite hunger and opportunity, they were commanded to abstain.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Theological Significance</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>The Nature of Divine Tests</h4>
            <p>This verse reveals profound insights about how God tests His servants:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessible Temptation:</strong> "That your hands and spears can reach" - the test is not through something impossible to obtain, but through something easily within grasp. The difficulty is in restraint, not in access.</li>

                <li><strong>Purpose of Testing:</strong> "So that Allah may make evident those who fear Him unseen" - the test reveals internal character. Who will obey God when no human is watching?</li>

                <li><strong>Unseen Fear (الْغَيْبِ):</strong> The test distinguishes those who have genuine تقوى (taqwa/God-consciousness) from those who merely perform external acts of worship.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <strong>يَخافُهُ بِالْغَيْبِ (Yakhāfuhu bil-Ghayb):</strong> "Fear Him unseen" or "fear Him in the unseen" - refers to consciousness of God's watchfulness even when no human observers are present. This is the essence of تقوى (taqwa) - not just avoiding sin, but avoiding it out of awareness of divine observation.
        </div>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h4>Historical Application: The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah</h4>
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> In 628 CE, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and 1,400 Muslims set out for pilgrimage to Mecca. They were stopped at Hudaybiyyah and forced into negotiations with the Quraysh. The resulting treaty seemed unfavorable, causing frustration among companions.</p>

            <p><strong>The Test:</strong> While encamped in ihram, the pilgrims encountered abundant game. The prohibition against hunting became a test of patience and obedience during an already difficult situation.</p>

            <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Obedience to God's commands is not conditional on circumstances feeling favorable. Even when frustrated with treaty terms, even when hungry, the divine law holds.</p>

            <p><strong>The Reward:</strong> The treaty, though seemingly unfavorable, led to the conquest of Mecca two years later. The Quran later called it "a clear victory" (Surah Al-Fath 48:1).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="moral-lesson">
            <h4>Contemporary Applications</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workplace Ethics:</strong> Following ethical guidelines even when "everyone else" is cutting corners and the boss isn't watching</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> Refusing to cheat even when answers are readily available and detection seems unlikely</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Honesty:</strong> Reporting all income accurately even when tax evasion would be easy and undetectable</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Age Privacy:</strong> Maintaining moral standards in private browsing, knowing that even if humans can't see, God's knowledge encompasses all</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>The Severe Warning</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>"And whoever transgresses after that - for him is a painful punishment"</strong>

            <p><strong>After what?</strong> After being clearly warned and informed. The severity increases because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The prohibition was explicitly stated</li>
                <li>The test was identified as a test (removing ignorance as excuse)</li>
                <li>The wisdom behind it (revealing true God-consciousness) was explained</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sinning in ignorance differs from sinning after clear knowledge and warning.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Verses 105-109: The Law of Testimony</h2>

        <div class="arabic-text">
            <span class="verse-number">105</span>
            يا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ لا يَضُرُّكُمْ مَنْ ضَلَّ إِذَا اهْتَدَيْتُمْ إِلَى اللَّـهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِما كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ
        </div>

        <div class="translation-box">
            <h4>Translation (Verse 105):</h4>
            <p>"O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided. To Allah is your return all together; then He will inform you of what you used to do."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Misunderstood Verse</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Common Misinterpretation:</strong> "Don't worry about others going astray; just focus on yourself."

            <p><strong>Danger of This Reading:</strong> It could justify abandoning الأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر (commanding good and forbidding evil) - a core Islamic obligation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Classical Scholarly Clarification</h4>
            <p><strong>Imam Al-Qurtubi explains:</strong> "This verse does not mean you should abandon commanding good and forbidding evil. Rather, it means: when you have fulfilled your obligation to advise and guide, the continued misguidance of others will not harm you."</p>

            <p><strong>Abu Bakr al-Siddiq's Interpretation:</strong> After reciting this verse, he said: "O people! You recite this verse and misapply it. I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: 'When people see evil and do not change it, Allah is about to inflict them all with punishment.' I command you to enjoin good and forbid evil."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Correct Understanding</h4>
            <p>The verse establishes two principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Individual Accountability:</strong> Each person bears responsibility for their own deeds</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Responsibility for Others:</strong> After you have fulfilled your duty to advise and guide, you are not accountable for others' choices</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>The Balance:</strong> You must attempt to guide those who are astray, but you are not responsible for their final decision. Your duty is to try; their choice is their burden.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Verse 106: The Testimony Law</h2>

        <div class="arabic-text">
            <span class="verse-number">106</span>
            يا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا شَهادَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ حِينَ الْوَصِيَّةِ اثْنانِ ذَوا عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ أَوْ آخَرانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنْتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَأَصابَتْكُمْ مُصِيبَةُ الْمَوْتِ تَحْبِسُونَهُما مِنْ بَعْدِ الصَّلاةِ فَيُقْسِمانِ بِاللَّـهِ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ لا نَشْتَرِي بِهِ ثَمَناً وَ لَوْ كانَ ذا قُرْبى‏ وَ لا نَكْتُمُ شَهادَةَ اللَّـهِ إِنَّا إِذاً لَمِنَ الْآثِمِينَ

            <h4>Translation (Verse 106):</h4>
            <p>"O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest - [that of] two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you. Detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], 'We will not exchange it for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimony of Allah. Indeed, we would then be among the sinful.'"</p>

            <strong>Revolutionary Aspect:</strong> This verse contains one of the rare permissions in Islamic law to accept testimony from non-Muslims in certain circumstances (when traveling and Muslim witnesses are unavailable). This demonstrates:
            <ul>
                <li>Pragmatic flexibility in Islamic jurisprudence</li>
                <li>Recognition that honesty exists across faith boundaries</li>
                <li>Priority of justice over strict formalism</li>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Procedural Safeguards</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> "After the prayer" - choosing a time of heightened spiritual awareness</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Oath:</strong> "Swear by Allah" - invoking divine witness</li>
                <li><strong>Incorruptibility Pledge:</strong> "We will not exchange it for a price" - no bribery</li>
                <li><strong>No Favoritism:</strong> "Even if he should be a near relative" - family ties don't override truth</li>
                <li><strong>Divine Accountability:</strong> "We will not withhold the testimony of Allah" - framing testimony as belonging to God, not the witness</li>

            <h4>Historical Context: The Case of Tameem al-Dari and Addi ibn Badda</h4>
            <p><strong>The Incident:</strong> Budayl ibn Abi Maryam, a Muslim, was traveling with two Christians (Tameem al-Dari and Addi ibn Badda). He fell ill and wrote a will, then died. His family discovered that a valuable silver vessel with gold decoration was missing.</p>

            <p><strong>The Accusation:</strong> The Christian witnesses denied taking it, swearing they knew nothing about the missing item.</p>

            <p><strong>The Discovery:</strong> The silver vessel was later found being sold in Mecca. When questioned, the sellers said they bought it from Tameem and Addi.</p>

            <p><strong>The Resolution:</strong> The heirs brought the case before the Prophet ﷺ. Following the procedure in verses 107-108, two Muslim witnesses from the family swore that the testimony of Tameem and Addi was false, and the property was returned to the rightful heirs.</p>

            <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Even with divine legislation, human corruption can occur. The law provides mechanisms for correction when deception is uncovered.</p>

            <p><strong>If Perjury is Discovered:</strong></p>

                <li>Two others from those with lawful rights (typically heirs) can step forward</li>
                <li>They take a counter-oath: "Our testimony is truer than theirs"</li>
                <li>They affirm they have not transgressed or lied</li>
                <li>Their testimony supersedes the false testimony</li>

        <div class="moral-lesson">
            <h4>The Psychological Deterrent</h4>
            <p><strong>Verse 108 reveals the wisdom:</strong> "That is more likely that they will give testimony according to its true objective"</p>

            <p><strong>The Deterrent Effect:</strong> Knowing that your testimony can be challenged and overturned creates pressure to tell the truth from the beginning. The possibility of exposure and humiliation incentivizes honesty.</p>

            <p><strong>Modern Parallel:</strong> Similar to perjury laws in modern legal systems, where lying under oath carries severe penalties, deterring false testimony.</p>

                <li><strong>Epistemic Humility:</strong> Even the prophets acknowledge the limits of their knowledge compared to divine omniscience</li>

                <li><strong>Deference to Divine Judgment:</strong> The prophets defer to Allah's superior knowledge rather than speaking from their limited human perspective</li>

            <p>These verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah establish a comprehensive framework for moral and legal conduct:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal Character:</strong> True faith is proven through restraint when transgression is easy (v.94)</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Responsibility:</strong> Each bears their own burden while fulfilling duties to others (v.105)</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Integrity:</strong> Even in difficult circumstances, truth must be preserved through structured testimony (v.106-108)</li>
                <li><strong>Divine Justice:</strong> All attempts at deception are futile before the Knower of the Unseen (v.109)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
            "Indeed, You are the Knower of the unseen" - Whether in times of ease or hardship, whether witnessed by others or alone, the divine gaze encompasses all. This awareness transforms legal obligation into spiritual refinement, and external compliance into internal devotion.
