________________________________________
🔹 Before Starting
1. Intention (Niyyah) – Pillar, in the heart
You do not say this out loud. You simply decide in your heart something like:
“I intend to perform four units (rak‘ahs) of the [Ẓuhr / ‘Aṣr / ‘Ishā’] prayer for the sake of Allah.”
________________________________________
🔹 Rak‘ah 1
2. Standing facing the Qiblah – Pillar (standing for recitation)
Stand upright, facing the direction of the Ka‘bah (qiblah), calmly.
3. Opening Takbīr (Takbīrat al-Iḥrām) – Pillar
Raise your hands (recommended) and say:
“Allah is the Greatest.”
This officially starts the prayer.
4. Optional Opening Supplication (recommended, not a pillar)
You may say (for example):
“Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You.
Blessed is Your Name, exalted is Your Majesty,
and there is no god but You.”
(Not required, only recommended.)
5. Recitation While Standing – Obligatory
a) Opening Chapter (al-Fātiḥah) – Obligatory (pillar in Shia fiqh)
“In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all worlds.
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.
Guide us to the straight path –
the path of those whom You have blessed,
not of those who incur anger, nor of those who go astray.”
b) Another complete chapter (surah) – Obligatory, but not a pillar
Common example: Chapter of Sincerity (Ikhlāṣ):
“In the Name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
Say: He is Allah, One.
Allah, the Self-Sufficient (the One on whom all depend).
He neither begets nor is born,
and there is none comparable to Him.”
6. Bowing (Rukū‘) – Pillar
From standing, bend forward until your hands can rest on your knees (or similar position).
While in bowing, say at least once (three times recommended):
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great, and praise is His.”
You must stay still for a moment while saying this.
7. Rising from Rukū‘ – Pillar (standing after rukū‘)
Rise back to standing, fully upright.
You may say (recommended, not obligatory):
“Allah hears the one who praises Him.”
or
“Allah is the Greatest.”
8. First Prostration (Sujūd 1) – Pillar (two prostrations per rak‘ah)
Go down to prostration: forehead on the ground (on a valid place), with your palms, knees, and toes placed correctly.
Say at least once (three times recommended):
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
Stay still while saying it.
9. Sitting between the Two Prostrations – Part of the sujūd pillar
Sit up from the first prostration, calmly.
Recommended to say:
“I seek forgiveness from Allah, my Lord, and I turn to Him.”
10. Second Prostration (Sujūd 2) – Pillar
Return to prostration and repeat:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
After finishing, you rise to stand for Rak‘ah 2.
________________________________________
🔹 Rak‘ah 2
Rak‘ah 2 is almost the same as Rak‘ah 1, but at the end you sit for Tashahhud.
11. Standing and Recitation
Standing again:
1.	Recite al-Fātiḥah (same English text as before).
2.	Recite another complete chapter (such as Ikhlāṣ).
12. Rukū‘ (bowing) – Pillar
Bend forward and say:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great, and praise is His.”
Then stand upright again.
13. Two Prostrations – Pillar
First prostration:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
Sit between them (recommended to seek forgiveness).
Second prostration:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
14. Sitting for Tashahhud – Obligatory (not a pillar)
After the second prostration of Rak‘ah 2, sit and recite the Tashahhud:
“I bear witness that there is no god except Allah,
alone, without partner.
And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger.
O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.”
Then stand up for Rak‘ah 3.
________________________________________
🔹 Rak‘ah 3
In Shia practice, in Rak‘ah 3 you may choose one of two ways while standing:
Option A: Recite al-Fātiḥah (like previous rak‘ahs)
Same English as before.
Option B: Recite the “Four Glorifications” (Tasbīḥāt al-Arba‘a) – Allowed instead of al-Fātiḥah
Recited three times:
“Glory be to Allah,
and praise be to Allah,
and there is no god except Allah,
and Allah is the Greatest.”
After the standing recitation (either Fātiḥah or the four glorifications):
15. Rukū‘ – Pillar
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great, and praise is His.”
Then stand up.
16. Two Prostrations – Pillar
Each prostration:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
Sit briefly after the second prostration, then stand up for Rak‘ah 4.
________________________________________
🔹 Rak‘ah 4
Rak‘ah 4 is similar to Rak‘ah 3, but at the end you recite both Tashahhud and Salām, then the prayer ends.
17. Standing and Recitation
Again, choose one:
•	al-Fātiḥah, or
•	the four glorifications three times:
“Glory be to Allah,
and praise be to Allah,
and there is no god except Allah,
and Allah is the Greatest.”
18. Rukū‘ – Pillar
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great, and praise is His.”
Then stand up.
19. Two Prostrations – Pillar
Each prostration:
“Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and praise is His.”
After the second prostration of Rak‘ah 4, you sit and remain seated.
________________________________________
🔹 Final Tashahhud and Salām
20. Final Tashahhud – Obligatory
While sitting:
“I bear witness that there is no god except Allah,
alone, without partner.
And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger.
O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.”
21. Salām (Ending the Prayer) – Obligatory
Still sitting, say:
“Peace be upon you, O Prophet,
and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.
Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah.
Peace be upon you all,
and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.”
With this, the four-rak‘ah prayer is complete.

📌 List of the Pillars (Arkān) in This Four-Rak‘ah Prayer
If a pillar is left out or invalidated, the prayer is invalid.
1.	Intention (Niyyah)
o	Intending in the heart the specific four-rak‘ah obligatory prayer for the sake of Allah.
2.	Opening Takbīr
o	Saying: “Allah is the Greatest.” at the start.
3.	Standing (Qiyām) for Takbīr and Recitation
o	Being upright while saying the opening takbīr and while reciting what must be recited.
4.	Recitation of al-Fātiḥah in the first two rak‘ahs
o	Its correct recitation is considered a pillar in Shia fiqh.
5.	Bowing (Rukū‘) in each rak‘ah
o	Proper bowing with stillness and required glorification.
6.	Rising from Rukū‘
o	Returning to full standing after bowing.
7.	Two Prostrations (Sujūd) in each rak‘ah
o	Both prostrations, on valid ground, with stillness and required glorification.
8.	Order (Tartīb)
o	Doing actions in their correct sequence (standing → recitation → bowing → prostrations…).
9.	Continuity (Muwālāt)
o	Not inserting long, unnecessary breaks between actions so that it still counts as one continuous prayer.
Other things (like Tashahhud and Salām) are obligatory, but technically not pillars: if they are forgotten, there are specific fixes in fiqh. Pillars, if invalid, normally break the prayer.
