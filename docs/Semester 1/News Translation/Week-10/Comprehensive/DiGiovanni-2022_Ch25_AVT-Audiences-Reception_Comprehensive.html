            <p>What an audience <strong>IS</strong> vs what it <strong>DOES</strong></p>
            <p>Applied to three types present in contemporary society:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>1. Simple Audience</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most traditional, perhaps least contemporary type</li>
                <li>Clear distinction between producers and consumers of performance</li>
                <li>Performance occurs in public space</li>
                <li>Participate in events with substantial ceremonial/sacred quality</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>2. Mass Audience</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ushered in by advent of mass communication and technology</li>
                <li>Moves experience from local to global sphere</li>
                <li>From public to private setting (more powerful and widespread)</li>
                <li>Tend to devote less attention to performance</li>
                <li><strong>Involvement:</strong> Medium</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>3. Diffused Audience</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Results from recent social and cultural changes</li>
                <li><strong>Main feature:</strong> Coming together of consumers and producers</li>
                <li>Part of performance and influences it in participatory ways</li>
                <li>Shifts focus from passive observation to active participation</li>
                <li>Expands notion of performance</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">"In contemporary society, everyone becomes an audience all the time. Being a member of an audience is no longer an exceptional event, nor even an everyday event. Rather, it is constitutive of everyday life." (1998: 61)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Performance and Audience</h4>
            <p class="quote">"Critical to what it means to be a member of an audience is the idea of performance. Audiences are groups of people before whom a performance of one kind or another takes place. Performance, in turn, is a kind of activity in which the person performing accentuates his or her behaviour under the scrutiny of others... It is 'behaviour heightened, if ever so slightly, and publicly displayed; twice-behaved behaviour' (Schechner, 1993, p. 1)."</p>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Anthropological Perspective</h4>
            <p>Athique reflects on audiences in relation to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Media globalization</li>
                <li>Transnational flows</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Globalization revolves around three forms of movement:</strong> Money, People, Media Content</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Diasporic Audiences</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Connected to minority cultural and linguistic groups</li>
                <li>Related to dominating role of mass broadcasters</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Networked Audiences</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Evoke notions of virtual, non-synchronous media consumption</li>
                <li>Recall Abercrombie & Longhurst's diffused audiences</li>
                <li>Shift from passive to active role</li>
                <li>Shape creation and distribution of media content</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">"Proceeding from the formal qualities of digital technologies, we naturally perceive the audience as being comprised of various device operators who are simultaneously interacting with malleable content and with each other. In this context, we can no longer assume the physical co-presence of audience members, nor their simultaneous activity in a common moment of time... the networked audience is inherently an 'active' proposition." (2016: 61)</p>

                <li><strong>Response:</strong> Investigated through psychological methodologies (common in experimental AVT studies)</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> Concerned with shared knowledge by partners in communication process and inferential processing</li>

            <h4>Kruger & Doherty (2018b)</h4>
            <p>Highlight importance of questionnaires and interviews in film and AVT studies, but encourage systematic inception of psychometric methods and tools:</p>
            <p class="quote">"The most obvious measure in determining audience reception of AVT products is post-hoc attitudinal questionnaires and interviews. This measure is a mainstay of film studies and will always remain an important way to obtain qualitative information. We will here focus on a different strand in reception research that is more focused on using psychometric instruments to determine the impact of AVT products on audience immersion, enjoyment and cognitive load."</p>

            <h4>Types of Measures</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subjective:</strong> Self-rating by respondents (e.g., perceived cognitive effort)</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Comprehension, recall, learning (though distinction is not clear-cut)</li>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Two Major Research Avenues</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Evolution of studies:</strong> Observe development in multi/interdisciplinary terms - analyze strategies and techniques over time (metadiscourse on media reception research)</li>
                <li><strong>Historical reception of texts:</strong> Explore reception over years/decades (aggregated audience) OR focus on given time, text, audience of the past</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>First avenue:</strong> More theoretical, doesn't necessarily focus on audience as 'people'</p>
            <p><strong>Second avenue:</strong> Firmly based on mapping people's reactions to audiovisual texts over time or in past</p>

        <h3>Historical Reception in AVT Studies</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Carol O'Sullivan & François Cornu</h4>
            <p>Pioneers in historical AVT research - reconstructing cinema history through translation lens</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-sound era:</strong> "Films were silent, but not speechless" (title cards, commentators)</li>
                <li><strong>Talkies:</strong> "Ushered multilingualism into cinema on a worldwide scale"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Individual Contributions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cornu (2014):</strong> Explored historical evolution of dubbing and subtitling in France and elsewhere</li>
                <li><strong>O'Sullivan (2018):</strong> Essay on film paratext - helps reflect on role of translation in film appreciation/success</li>

            <h4>O'Sullivan on Paratext</h4>
            <p>Drawing on Genette's theory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Peritext:</strong> Elements internal to main text (e.g., subtitles burned onto film reel)</li>
                <li><strong>Epitext:</strong> Elements external to main text (e.g., today's multi-faceted subtitle options for viewers)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact on reception:</strong> Interesting to investigate how this affects appreciation</p>

        <h3>Retranslation</h3>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Central to Diachronic Reception Studies</h4>
            <p class="quote">"Retranslation is an intrinsic feature of AVT. This has not, to date, been much investigated in AVT studies, which have tended to think in terms of the dubbed and the subtitled version of a film. However, it is common for the same film to be subtitled more than once into a single language for theatrical exhibition, for DVD release, for television, on reissues of restored films). It is also not uncommon for films to be dubbed more than once into a single language." (O'Sullivan 2018: 270)</p>

            <p><strong>Current research:</strong> On the increase (Zanotti 2011, 2015; Di Giovanni 2016; Mereu Keating 2016)</p>
            <p><strong>Contributes to:</strong> Exploration of aggregated audiences (all people who viewed/appreciated AV texts in translation over time)</p>
            <p><strong>Common denominator:</strong> Archival research (film archives, libraries, private documents, journals, publishing houses)</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Reception Studies in AVT: The Tools</h2>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Current trend:</strong> "Much of the recent research on AVT has focused on the examination of cognitive processing of audiovisual texts" (Kruger & Doherty 2018b: 91)</p>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Phenomenon increasingly recorded over slightly less than ten years, especially since media accessibility became well-established</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Cognitive Approaches: Historical Development</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Translation Studies:</strong> Linguistic studies showed interest in cognitive processes (e.g., Levý 1967)</li>
                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Specific publications began appearing, "mostly without relying on input from cognitive psychology"</li>
                <li><strong>1990s:</strong> Surge in empirical research on non-literary translation → more careful eye on psychological theories/methodologies</li>
                <li><strong>Turn of century:</strong> Cognitive approaches in full bloom (PACTE research group 2003)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Offline vs Online Measures (Kruger & Doherty)</h3>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Offline Measures</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rely mainly on questionnaires and interviews</li>
                <li>Aim to gauge: comprehension, recall, learning, cognitive load, immersion</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-term">
            <h4>Online Measures</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Related essentially to eye tracking and electroencephalography</li>
                <li>Defined as "typically more objective and physiological"</li>
                <li>Obtained through tools respondents cannot control</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Functional Distinction (Di Giovanni 2018b)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Essentially gauged by online measures</li>
                <li><strong>Reception:</strong> Requires both types of measures for complete evaluation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both types converge onto overall evaluation of reception</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Key Research Examples</h3>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Perego, Del Missier & Bottiroli (2015)</h4>
            <p><strong>Unusual approach:</strong> Evaluated reception of subtitles against dubbing for same film and language pair</p>

            <h4>Multi-section Questionnaire Combined:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive measures:</strong> General comprehension, dialogue recognition, face-name association, visual scene recognition</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluative measures:</strong> Film appreciation, self-reported effort, judgments of memory</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Points to:</strong> Great variability of psychological (cognitive) measures in classification and application</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scholar-box">
            <h4>Szarkowska & Gerber Morón (2018)</h4>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Reading speed for subtitles and reception</p>
            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Constant increase in reading speeds globally (encouraged by Netflix)</p>
            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 70 individuals</p>
            <p><strong>Languages:</strong> English, Polish, Spanish</p>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Questionnaire (offline) + eye tracker (online)</p>

            <h4>Parameters Evaluated:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Comprehension</li>

            <h4>Results:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants had no difficulties processing fast subtitles</li>
                <li>No increase in cognitive load or significant loss of visual intake</li>
                <li><strong>Unexpected:</strong> Cognitive load generally higher for English-speaking participants regardless of subtitle speed (possibly due to limited exposure to subtitling)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>What the Future Holds</h2>

        <div class="critical-point">
            <h4>Current Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Constant increase in extemporaneous, individual, private consumption</li>
                <li>Exponential growth of video-on-demand and streaming platforms</li>
                <li>Accentuated by pandemic lockdown worldwide</li>
                <li>Mapping reception becoming increasingly challenging</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>Paradox: Audiences More Proactive (Di Giovanni 2019)</h4>
            <p>Today's media audiences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Influence production and worldwide distribution</li>
                <li>Criticize untimely distribution (and translation) choices with great resonance through blogs/social media</li>
                <li>Increasingly direct content producers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Great dynamism in consumption modes and shifting audience roles → need to reconsider observation tools and strategies</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Innovative Trends in Audience-Centred AVT Research</h3>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>1. Accessible Filmmaking (Pablo Romero Fresco 2019)</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> 'Accessibility' = all that serves purpose of allowing any person to enjoy a film (from translation to audio description)</p>

            <h4>Key Principles:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Films designed as accessible from very first conceptual steps</li>
                <li>Catering for interlingual translations, captions, AD as part of production stage (NOT post-production)</li>
                <li>Redesigns space for translators - highlighting relevance as part of film production</li>
                <li>Supports production of <strong>films for all</strong> (accessible for people with host of different abilities)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Application:</strong> Can be applied to series, theatre, live shows - all media texts</p>
            <p><strong>Audience role:</strong> Tantamount - diverse needs at core of perspective</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>2. From Accessibility to Inclusion</h4>
            <p><strong>Bottom-up approach:</strong> Questioning conventional notion of accessibility</p>

            <h4>Key Shift:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>'Disability' → 'Alternative abilities'</li>
                <li>All abilities essential to design and equal consumption</li>
                <li>Different abilities = essence of true inclusion</li>
                <li>Leave behind idea of dis-abilities needing access to something un-accessible</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Origins in AVT Practice:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Connected to fansubbing and fandubbing</li>
                <li>Empowerment of consumers turned <strong>produsers</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>New stance:</strong> Embracing notion of diffused audiences and diluted notion of performance pervading our lives</p>
        </div>

        <div class="important">
            <h4>3. Inclusive Design and Design-for-All</h4>
            <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> People (not services or texts) at core of creative efforts</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> "Provide all people with dignity, comfort and convenience" (Nussbaumer 2012: 33)</p>
            <p><strong>Allows:</strong> People to be independent and participate equally</p>
            <p><strong>Like accessible filmmaking:</strong> Focuses on diverse audience needs as foundation</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="concept-box">
            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Audience definition:</strong> Tantamount to setting up any reception study</li>
                <li><strong>Chameleonic nature:</strong> Audiences change over time, across space, based on scholar's viewpoint and research aims</li>
                <li><strong>Once stance taken:</strong> Decisions needed on type of analysis, methodology, tools, expected results</li>
